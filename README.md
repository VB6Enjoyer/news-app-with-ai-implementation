# The future of online news

<i>Not...</i>

This web app was built using React + Vite in practically a single day. It allows the user to obtain news headlines from an API and to consult some data about them, as well as get redirected to them. The app also allows the user to search news based on particular keywords or topics, and provides AI-powered "sentiment" ratings, which try to give percentages of positivity, neutrality and negativity to each headline; it uses one of HuggingFace's APIs.

This repository is practically for self-training purposes and it's no intended to be an actual application for production or deployment. Future changes might be made to expand on its functionality for further developmentn of my own skills.
